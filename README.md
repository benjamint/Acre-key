Acre & Key is an AI-powered real estate ecosystem that replaces the tedious process of manual
searching and filtering with two conversational agents: Acre (for seekers) and Key (for property
owners/managers).
Unlike traditional portals, users don't "search" for properties; they "brief" Acre. Acre then scours
the web, qualifies listings, and presents them on a unified, high-intent board.

Product objectives

● Conversational discovery: Replace complex filters with natural language understanding (NLU).

● Web-scale sourcing: Aggregate and "cleanse" data from multiple sources (MLS, private
sites, Facebook groups, etc.).

● Eﬃciency: Reduce the "time-to-viewing" by handling initial queries and vetting
autonomously.
